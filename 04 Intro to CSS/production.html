        <h2>how do we do it?</h2>


        <p>At Spoke & Wheel, we craft our mountain bike rims with precision and performance in mind. Using premium
            aluminum alloy or carbon fiber, each rim is carefully formed—aluminum profiles are cut, shaped, and joined,
            while carbon rims are molded using high-pressure composite layering. We drill spoke holes at exact angles
            for optimal strength and compatibility, then apply durable finishes like anodizing or paint. Every rim
            undergoes strict quality control to ensure it meets our standards for strength, balance, and
            durability—<strong>ready for whatever the trail throws your way.</strong>


        <h2>process</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Each carbon rim begins with high-strength composite fibers carefully layered into precision-engineered
                molds. The rim is then cured under controlled heat and pressure, creating a lightweight yet incredibly
                durable structure optimized for trail performance.</li>
            <li>Once formed, the rim is drilled with spoke holes at precise angles to ensure optimal spoke alignment. A
                protective clear coat is applied for added durability and a sleek finish, followed by a rigorous
                inspection to guarantee roundness, balance, and long-term reliability on the trail.</li>
        </ol>
